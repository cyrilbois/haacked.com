message: It seems to me that LOD is especially useful/applicable if the object returned from an violation goes through various transformation such as the wallet example. However, if there are not any transformation logic, as in the UI & driver's license example. We could justify it by saying one of the chained objects serve as containers, and the violation is okay.
