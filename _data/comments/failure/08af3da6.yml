  I remember when you were working on Koders and I was evaluating it for my org. There was a strong customer need and the solution, while not unique (I think Black Duck were the competition, and didn't they acquire Koders in the end?), it was compelling because it understood the user need more that the competition.



  I've worked with lots of start-ups / scale-ups / successful mature businesses over my 20+ years in consulting and one thing has always struck me - the technology doesn't matter. I've seen some insanely successful products that are an absolute horror show behind the scenes (technology / people / processes), but it never really mattered because they had nailed the value proposition and had a sizeable Total Addressable Market (TAM). The technology was always a mechanism to reduce the cost of delivery of the value.



  The best advice I can give is read Disciplined Entrepreneurship by Bill Aulet or the "New Product Development" blog series by my business partner:
